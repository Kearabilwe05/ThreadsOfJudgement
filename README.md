## What Makes This Game Innovative

### üé≠ Authentic Reddit Content Integration
Every moral dilemma comes from **real Reddit posts** in communities like r/AmItheAsshole, r/TIFU, r/relationships, and r/WorkplaceStories, ensuring genuine, relatable situations that spark meaningful debate.

**Example Scenarios:**
- **r/AITA**: "AITA for not inviting my sister to my wedding?" - Family drama with toxic relationships where players choose between "You're not the asshole - your wedding, your choice" vs "You're the asshole - family should come first" vs "Everyone sucks here - both sides are wrong"
- **r/TIFU**: "TIFU by accidentally sending a love letter to my boss" - Workplace embarrassment where players decide between apologizing immediately, pretending it never happened, making a joke, or looking for a new job
- **r/Relationships**: "My partner wants to move across the country for their dream job" - Life-changing decisions where players weigh love vs career with options for moving together, staying put, trying long distance, or taking a break
- **r/Workplace**: "Coworker takes credit for my ideas in meetings" - Professional conflicts where players choose between direct confrontation, documentation and escalation, presenting ideas in writing first, or finding a new job

### üß† Advanced Moral Psychology Engine
